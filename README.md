The package provides you with a simple solution that allows you to effortlessly create hierarchical structures for your Eloquent models.
It leverages the [materialized path](#materialized-path) pattern to represent the hierarchy of your data.
It can be used for a wide range of use cases such as managing categories, nested comments, and more.

## ðŸ”Œ Installation

Install the package via Composer:

```bash
composer require nevadskiy/laravel-tree
````

## âœ¨ How it works

When working with hierarchical data structures in your application, storing the structure using a self-referencing `parent_id` column is a common approach.
While it works well for many use cases, it can become challenging when you need to make complex queries, such as finding all descendants of a given node.
One of the simples and effective solutions is the [materialized path](#materialized-path) pattern.

### Materialized path

The "materialized pattern" involves storing the full path of each node in the hierarchy in a separate `path` column as a string.
The ancestors of each node are represented by a series of IDs separated by a delimiter.

For example, the categories database table might look like this:

| id | name           | parent_id |  path |
|:---|:---------------|----------:|------:|
| 1  | Science        |      null |     1 |
| 2  | Physics        |         1 |   1.2 |
| 3  | Mechanics      |         2 | 1.2.3 |
| 4  | Thermodynamics |         2 | 1.2.4 |

With this structure, you can easily retrieve all descendants of a node using a SQL query:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM categories WHERE path LIKE '1.%'
```

#### PostgreSQL Ltree extension

Using the [PostgreSQL ltree](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ltree.html) extension we can go even further. This extension provides an additional `ltree` column type designed specifically for this purpose.
In combination with a GiST index it allows executing lightweight and performant queries across an entire tree.

Now the SQL query will look like this:

```SQL
SELECT * FROM categories WHERE path ~ '1.*'
```

## ðŸ”¨ Configuration

All you have to do is to add a `AsTree` trait to the model and add a `path` column alongside the self-referencing `parent_id` column to the model's table.

Let's get started by configuring a `Category` model:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Nevadskiy\Tree\AsTree;

class Category extends Model
{
    use AsTree;
}
```

Next, create a migration for the model. The definition of the `path` column depends on your database connection.

#### Using PostgreSQL database

To add a `path` column with the `ltree` type and a GiST index, use the following code:

```php
$table->ltree('path')->nullable()->spatialIndex();
```

The complete migration file may look like this:

```php
<?php

use Illuminate\Database\Migrations\Migration;
use Illuminate\Database\Schema\Blueprint;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Schema;

return new class extends Migration
{
    public function up(): void
    {
        Schema::create('categories', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->id();
            $table->string('name');
            $table->ltree('path')->nullable()->spatialIndex();
            $table->timestamps();
        });

        Schema::table('categories', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->foreignId('parent_id')
                ->nullable()
                ->index()
                ->constrained('categories')
                ->cascadeOnDelete();
        });
    }

    public function down(): void
    {
        Schema::dropIfExists('categories');
    }
};
```

Sometimes the Ltree extension may be disabled in PostgreSQL. To enable it, you can publish and run a package migration:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --tag=pgsql-ltree-migration
```

#### Using MySQL or SQLite database

To add a string `path` column with and an index, use the following code:

```php
$table->string('path')->nullable()->index();
```

## ðŸšŠ Usage

Once you have configured your model, the package **automatically** handles all manipulations with the `path` attribute based on the parent, so you do not need to set it manually.

### Inserting models

To insert a root node, simply save the model to the database:

```php
$root = new Category();
$root->name = 'Science';
$root->save();
```

To insert a child model, you only need to assign the `parent_id` attribute or use the `parent` or `children` relation:

```php
$child = new Category;
$child->name = 'Physics';
$child->parent()->associate($root);
$child->save();
```

As you can see, it works just as regular Eloquent models.

### Relations

The `AsTree` trait provides the following relations:

- [`parent`](#parent)
- [`children`](#children)
- [`ancestors`](#ancestors) (read-only)
- [`descendants`](#descendants) (read-only)

The `parent` and `children` relations use default Laravel `BelongsTo` and `HasMany` relation classes.

The `ancestors` and `descendants` can be used only in the "read" mode, which means methods like `make` or `create` are not available.
So to save related nodes you need to use the `parent` or `children` relation.

#### Parent

The `parent` relation uses the default Eloquent `BelongsTo` relation class that needs the `parent_id` column as a foreign key.
It allows getting a parent of the node.

```php
echo $category->parent->name;
```

#### Children

The `children` relation uses a default Eloquent `HasMany` relation class and is a reverse relation to the `parent`.
It allows getting all children of the node.

```php
foreach ($category->children as $child) {
    echo $child->name;
}
```

#### Ancestors

The `ancestors` relation is a custom relation that works only in "read" mode.
It allows getting all ancestors of the node (without the current node).

Using the attribute:

```php
foreach ($category->ancestors as $ancestor) {
    echo $ancestor->name;
}
```

Using the query builder:

```php
$ancestors = $category->ancestors()->get();
```

Getting a collection with the current node and its ancestors:

```php
$hierarchy = $category->joinAncestors();
```

#### Descendants

The `descendants` relation is a custom relation that works only in "read" mode.
It allows getting all descendants of the node (without the current node).

Using the attribute:

```php
foreach ($category->descendants as $descendant) {
    echo $descendant->name;
}
```

Using the query builder:

```php
$ancestors = $category->descendants()->get();
```

### Querying models

Getting root nodes:

```php
$roots = Category::query()->root()->get();
```

Getting nodes by the depth level:

```php
$categories = Category::query()->whereDepth(3)->get();
```

Getting ancestors of the node (including the current node):

```php
$ancestors = Category::query()->whereSelfOrAncestorOf($category)->get();
```

Getting descendants of the node (including the current node):

```php
$descendants = Category::query()->whereSelfOrDescendantOf($category)->get();
```

Ordering nodes by depth:

```php
$categories = Category::query()->orderByDepth()->get();
$categories = Category::query()->orderByDepthDesc()->get();
```

### HasManyDeep

The package provides the `HasManyDeep` relation that can be used to link, for example, a `Category` model that uses the `AsTree` trait with a `Product` model.

That allows us to get products of a category and each of its descendants.

Here is the code example on how to use the `HasManyDeep` relation:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
use Nevadskiy\Tree\AsTree;
use Nevadskiy\Tree\Relations\HasManyDeep;

class Category extends Model
{
    use AsTree;

    public function products(): HasManyDeep
    {
        return HasManyDeep::between($this, Product::class);
    }
}
```

Now you can get products:

```php
$products = $category->products()->paginate(20);
```

### Querying category products

You can easily get the products of a category and each of its descendants using a query builder.

1st way (recommended):

```php
$products = Product::query()
    ->join('categories', function (JoinClause $join) {
        $join->on('products.category_id', 'categories.id');
    })
    ->whereSelfOrDescendantOf($category)
    ->paginate(24, ['products.*']);
```

2nd way (slower):

```php
$products = Product::query()
    ->whereHas('category', function (Builder $query) use ($category) {
        $query->whereSelfOrDescendantOf($category);
    })
    ->paginate(24);
```

### Moving nodes

When you move a node, the `path` column of the node and each of its descendants have to be updated as well.
Fortunately, the package does this automatically using a single query every time it sees that the `parent_id` column has been updated.

So basically to move a node along with its subtree, you need to update the `parent` node of the current node:

```php
$science = Category::query()->where('name', 'Science')->firstOrFail();
$physics = Category::query()->where('name', 'Physics')->firstOrFail();

$physics->parent()->associate($science);
$physics->save();
```

### Other examples

#### Building a tree

To build a tree, we need to call the `tree` method on the `NodeCollection`:

```php
$tree = Category::query()->orderBy('name')->get()->tree();
```

This method associates nodes using the `children` relation and returns only root nodes.

#### Building breadcrumbs

```php
echo $category->joinAncestors()->reverse()->implode('name', ' > ');
```

#### Deleting a subtree

Delete the current node and all its descendants:

```php
$category->newQuery()->whereSelfOrDescendantOf($category)->delete();
```
